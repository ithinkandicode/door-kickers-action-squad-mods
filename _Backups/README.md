Backups for when I inevitably cause an irreversable crash.

Also used to diff final mod with original game files, to find changed files. This will be especially helpfl if the game gets an update.

Also includes the Press Kit, because the pictures are brilliant and I'd planned to se them in some of my mods and guides.

There's also a small collection of my various save files, used for testing the game.

And mod_root is my base mod file. All new mods start from there. It provides a skeleton structure with everything already in place, ready to add vanilla files from the media 1.2.2 backup and start writing the mod :D
