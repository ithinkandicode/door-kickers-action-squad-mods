## Notes

DPS = Damage per second, RF = Rapid Fire, STK = Shots to kill (unarmored enemy).

Accuracy is pretty similar. Close quarters, DPS is more important. At range, Recon's last two guns have almost perfect accuracy for his Rapid Fire.

Recoil controls how long you can fire for before your shots veer off. Recon can lay down sustained fire by firing his main shot for a few rounds, swtching to Rapid Fre, and repeat.

The big outlier for recoil is the UZI. Very low STK, but your recoil will be crazy after 5 sustained shots.

All STKs for RF are 1 less than normal shot STK.

Move speed reduction is always -20% while shooting.

MP5 is the outlier across the board. Low DPS, low STK, long reload, no AP. It has Aimed Shot, but once you get good with Recon you'll find his Rapid Fire is just as effective. But it's very quiet.
