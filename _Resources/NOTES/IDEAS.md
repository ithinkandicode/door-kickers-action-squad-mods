### Stat Bars

Gun stat bars show more helpful info.

- [ ] "Damage" replaced with "DPS" {MAYBE} - Will this work for Agent?
- [ ] Gun stats are now relative to each class (eg. full Accuracy bar = most accurate gun for that class, not most accurate gun overall)
- Shotguns & Pistols:
  - New full/empty bar slam for fire, a vanilla feature for some pistols and shotguns. It lets you spam the fire button to sacrafice accuracy for huge DPS.

> I feel as if though a way to implement the restriction of strategic points from Infinate Mode would be great for creating harder/hardcore levels!
