## 2022 Ideas

- Agent: New armor, "bomb suit" - to reduce explosion damage



### MOD: Levels Pack

- BAT file to copy .dkas files from %LocalAppData% to game dir
- Custom level images
- Correct strings


### MOD: Super Door Kicker Brothers [REPACK]

- Repack the tilset, it needs the PNG from the 3rd level mod


### MOD: Big Explosions

- Makes grenades use barrel explosions (breach + napalm)


### MOD: Consistent Climbables

- Make all boxes and squad cars climbale
- Opens new routes!
- Eg. 6.7


### Misc

- TEST: Slightly increase breach fire rate, so door kicks are faster
- Find out how jumpSpeed changes jumps:	-270

### Modes

- Turbo Mode - Everything is 10-20% faster (fire rate, reload etc)
- Hard Mode A - Enemies have 30% more health (for co-op)
- Hard Mode B - No strategic points, only from hostages, like in Infinite Tower
- Hard Mode C - More enemies in default maps - probably better for co-op than better than +enemy HP

### New Weapons

- [x] Semi-Auto G18C (Agent)
- [ ] Bolt-action Rifle (single shot sniper)
- [ ] Shuriken (ninja stars) - High spread, high damage, fast fire rate, small penetration
- [ ] Sawn-Off Shotgun (High mobility, low range, huge spread)
- [ ] Taser/Stun/Stun gun (wi. pistol alt)
- [ ] Laser rifle (fire beam) - would insane fire rate = continuous beam??
- [ ] M1921 Thompson (Tommy Gun) + Hail Fire
- [x] Dbl. Barrelled Shotgun (done for ODG's Hunting Shotgun!)
- [x] Hand Cannon (already made as Automag V!)
- [ ] Golden Pistol
- [x] Dual Clip (tried this with the PDW, didn't work well)
- [ ] True SIX12 Modular (shotgun + AR) (maybe add a new weapon to replace SIX12, then add an alt modded SIX12?)


### Nopes

- [ ] Needler (Recon) - Tried, wasn't good, try Shirukens istead
- [ ] Incendiary Grenade - Not possible, can't set sounds + animations for custom explosions

> I feel as if though a way to implement the restriction of strategic points from Infinate Mode would be great for creating harder/hardcore levels!
