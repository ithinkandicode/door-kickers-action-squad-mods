Some mods disable saving stars. These are mods that change levels, scripts, weapons and gear.

But there is a workaround. You can run the mods locally, ie. by modifying the games core files, instead of enabling them from the game's Workshop menu. It's a bit of a hack, and if the mods you're using update then you'll have to do it all over again, but it works.

In this example we'll use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853]REBALANCE[/url] and its compatible version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980522551]Level Pack[/url].

Music and texture mods don't prevent stars from saving, so you are free to enable them from the in-game Workshop menu. If any of them prevent you unlocking stars, disable all of them, test the game, then enable them one-by-one to find which mod is preventing stars saving.

[h3]Get your mods[/h3]

Subscribe to the mods you want in the Steam Workshop. Keep their pages open. Eg:

[code]
s teamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853
s teamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980522551
[/code]

[i]note: the S is separate because otherwise Steam Guides changes these URLs into the mod previews you can see above[/i]

Start the game.

Enable the mods you want to use. This step is important because it will tell you if there are any conflicts.

Double-check the Workshop pages you have open. Close any that you can't use because of conflicts, and only keep the pages for the mods that you can use open.

When you know which mods you can use, disable them in the game, then close the game. But keep the web pages open.

[h3]Prepare the game folder[/h3]

Open the game folder. (You can do this in Steam: right-click the game in the left side list, go to Manage > Browse local files).

[previewicon=17783332;sizeOriginal,inline;gamedir.png][/previewicon]

Rename the media folder to "media_VANILLA". Open the renamed folder and add a text file called VANILLA.txt.

Copy and paste the "media_VANILLA" folder. Rename this one "media_MODS". Open it and rename the text file to "MODS.txt".

[previewicon=17783688;sizeOriginal,inline;guide-game-2-folders.PNG][/previewicon]

The text files aren't important to the process, but if you ever lose track of which folder is which, the text files will tell you :) You can also the MODS.txt file and paste in the URLs to the mods you're using, to keep track of them.

[h3]Copy the mod files[/h3]

Press Win+R to open the Run dialog

Paste this and press enter:

[code]%LOCALAPPDATA%\KillHouseGames\ActionSquad[/code]

[previewicon=17783331;sizeOriginal,inline;appdata-folder.png][/previewicon]

Copy and paste the file "userdata.bin" and name it "userdata.bin.bkp". This is your save file. If anything goes wrong, you can now restore your save.

Open the folder named "mods".

This folder contains all the mods you've downloaded.

[previewicon=17783334;sizeOriginal,inline;mods-appdata-wide.png][/previewicon]

Look at the Steam Workshop pages for the mods you subscribed to earlier.

At the end of their URLs is a long number. This corresponds to the numbered mod folders.

[code]
s teamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853
s teamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980522551

1973847853 = REBALANCE
1980522551 = Level Pack - REBALANCE Compatible
[/code]

Open the folder that corresponds to your mod ID. Go into the "mod_root" folder, then the "media" folder.

[previewicon=17783351;sizeOriginal,inline;appdata-mod-rebalance.png][/previewicon]

Copy everything from here.

Open your "media_MODS" folder and paste in the files you just copied. Choose "Yes"  to overwrite.

Repeat the process for the next mod.

[h3]Be careful of conflicts[/h3]

Something to remember is: There might be more files in the "mod_root\media" folder than the files that are actually used in the mod. If you have issues, or want to play it safe from the start, look in the "mod_root" folder for a file named mod_desc.xml and open it in a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++. At the end of the mod_desc is a list of the files the mod uses.

[previewicon=17783420;sizeOriginal,inline;appdata-mod-rebalance-desc-xml.png][/previewicon]

REBALANCE (shown above) changes a lot of things so it could conflict with lots of mods. To use Level Pack with it, use the special compatible version of the mod (1980522551).

If you look at the mod_desc.xml for [i]Level Pack - REBALANCE Compatible
[/i] you'll see it only includes one file, missions.xml, which doesn't conflict with REBLANCE's files. The rest of the files are all commented out, with [b]<!--[/b] and [b]-->[/b] (so these lines are ignored)

[previewicon=17783486;sizeOriginal,inline;appdata-mod-levelpack-compat-desc-xml.png][/previewicon]

[h3]Ready to play[/h3]

Now just rename "media_MODS" to "media" and start the game. It will tell you there is a  "CHANGE DETECTED" but that's normal.

You might also want to double-check the Workshop menu. It's a good idea to disable every mod and restart the game, to make sure that if there are issues, they're not being caused by a mod that was accidentally left enabled.

[h3]Testing[/h3]

To test if stars save properly, you can reset your progress through Options > More Options, then play the very first level. BUT make sure you made a backup of your save file first, otherwise your progress will be lost forever!

When you've done your test, you can delete the freshly reset userdata.bin, then copy and paste your backup (userdata.bin.bkp) and rename it to just userdata.bin.

But [b]always keep that save file backup safe[/b], just in case. You could even copy it into a separate folder called "seriously_important_dkas_backup", so you know it's seriously safe :D

[h3]Reverting to vanilla[/h3]

You can go back to vanilla by just renaming your folders. The text files let you keep track of which folder is which.

[h3]Note on the Level Pack mod[/h3]

The level pack requires some setup. There are instructions on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980275432]main mod page[/url]. I made a batch script that can set everything up for you, via the "Symlink Guide - Automatic" guide linked in the description. When you switch media folders remember to run the script again.

[previewicon=17783733;sizeOriginal,inline;guide-run-setup.png][/previewicon]

I wrote the setup script before I made this guide, so the message "You can now enable the Level Pack mod" doesn't apply, because you've basically enabled it already by overwriting the main game files.

If you see [url=https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/raw/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/images/validation/folder-exists.png]this[/url] message then you already ran the setup for this particular media folder, so you don't need to do it again.
...

Happy breaching!
