# Symlink - Automatic

This method uses a batch script to make the symlink. It's easier and faster than the manual method.

Here's a video of what this process looks like: https://youtu.be/2Wdphu0VGEc

- Go to the main Level Pack folder in this repo [here](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/tree/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack)
- Click on tthis file: [LEVEL_PACK_SETUP.bat](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/LEVEL_PACK_SETUP.bat)
- Press the Raw button, it's to the top-right of the top of the file preview
- Right-click the plain text that's now shown and chose "Save As"
- Save the file as LEVEL_PACK_SETUP.bat
- Move the file to the game's folder (find this through Steam: Right-click the game, go to Manage > Browse local files).
- LEVEL_PACK_SETUP.bat should now be in the same folder as ActionSquad.exe
- Right-click the .bat file and choose "Run as Administrator"
- It should work immediately. If it doesn't, make a screenshot and add it to the comments below (remember to use MS Paint to cover up yor PC username)
- That's it! :D

Here are screenshots of what happens when the batch script works, and when it doesn't: [screenshots](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/validation.md)
