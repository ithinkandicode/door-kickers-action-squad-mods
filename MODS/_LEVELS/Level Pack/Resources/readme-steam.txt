[b]Requires some setup.[/b]

You need to be able to run the Command Prompt as an administrator.

You also need to subscribe to every level in this pack.

Note: This isn't a repack. It doesn't contain the levels themselves. It just lets you play them in main game, as if they were part of the base game.

[h2]Overview[/h2]

Adds two new episodes: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1897469831]Red Storm[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041145962/myworkshopfiles/?appid=686200]Stryker_Ben[/url], and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1880985703]Siege[/url] by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/HARUMORI/myworkshopfiles/?appid=686200]Haru Moritaka[/url].

Red Storm is slightly harder than the main game. Siege is incredibly difficult. Both are excellent and very fun.

The Red Storm campaign has a story. You can read each level's synopsis on the individual level pages in the Steam Workshop. Link to each episode are at the end. I really recommend reading each synopsis before playing each level, it's nice having a backstory to the levels you play, and the propoganda poster artwork is great.

[b]This version of Level Pack is NOT compatible with Rebalance, but I will release a version shortly that is.[/b]

[h2]Setup[/h2]

This whole process will take about 5 minutes.

First subscribe to everything:

[list]
[*] Subscribe to this mod
[*] Subscribe to every level from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1897469831]Red Storm[/url]
[*] Subscribe to every level from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1880985703]Siege[/url].
[/list]
Then:

[list]
[*] Make sure the subscribed mods are in the right game folder:
[list][*] Start the game once, enter the Workshop menu, then close the game
[*] This makes the game copy the subscribed mods into the right place[/list]
[*] Make a symlink as [b]described below[/b]
[*] Check that making the symlink worked:
[list][*] Go into the game folder
[*] Go to media > levels > mission
[*] There should be what looks like a shortcut, named "mod"
[*] [url=https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/images/screenshots-windows/missions.png]Screenshot of missions folder[/url]
[*] Double-click this and it should take you to the mods folder, which is full of numbered folders
[*] [url=https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/images/screenshots-windows/mods-game.png]Screenshot of mods folder[/url] - you might have more or less folders, it depends how many mods you're subscribed to[/list]
[*] Start the game
[*] Enable this mod from the Workshop menu (you don't need to enable the levels)
[*] Restart the game after enabling it
[*] Go to the level select
[*] Check the last few episodes. There should be 2 new ones
[list][*] Check all the levels. If any are missing, you need to subscribe to them. If every level is missing even thugh you've subscribed to them, the symlink wasn't made properly.
[*] Note: The new episods have some level spaces, shown with yellow police tape. This is normal. Red Storm has 7 levels, so there should be 5 spaces. Siege has 8 levels, so 4 spaces.[/list]
[/list]
[h2]Making a symlink[/h2]

Making the symlink lets this Level Pack mod add downloaded workshop levels to the main game.

You can either download a batch script (.bat file) I made, or you can do this process manually.

I recommend the bat file, it's much simpler. It has lots of validation to make sure you're doing everything right.

For both methods you [b]must[/b] be using a PC account with admnistrator privileges.

[h3]Method 1: Batch File[/h3]

Steam won't let me save the dtails here so I've made a separate guide on Github:

[url=https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/symlink-automatic.md]Symlink Guide - Automatic[/url]

Here's a video of what the process looks like: https://youtu.be/2Wdphu0VGEc

And here are some screenshots of what happens when the batch script works, and when it doesn't: [url=https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/validation.md]screenshots[/url]

[h3]Method 2: Manual[/h3]

Here's a guide for making the symlink manually:

[h2]FAQs[/h2]

[*] Loads of questions are answered in the [url=https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/questions.md]FAQs on Github[/url]

[h3]Notes for modders[/h3]

The game only supports up to 9 episodes (level packs), so unfortunately, if someone makes a new campaign, this mod can't be updated to support it -- it's already using all 9 episode slots.
