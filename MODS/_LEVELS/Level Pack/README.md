# Level Pack

__Requires some setup. You need to be able to run the Command Prompt as an administrator.__

## Overview

Adds two new episodes: [Red Storm](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1897469831) by [Stryker_Ben](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041145962/myworkshopfiles/?appid=686200), and [Siege](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1880985703) by [Haru Moritaka](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1880985703).

Red Storm is slightly harder than the main game. Siege is incredibly difficult. Both are excellent and very fun.

The Red Storm campaign has a story. You can read each level's synopsis on the individual level pages in the Steam Workshop. Link to each episode are at the end. I really recommend reading each synopsis before playing each level, it's nice having a backstory to the levels you play, and the propoganda poster artwork is great.

__This version of Level Pack is NOT compatible with Rebalance, but I will release a version shortly that is.__


## Setup

First subscribe to everything:

- Subscribe to this mod
- Subscribe to every level from [Red Storm](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1897469831)
- Subscribe to every level from [Siege](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1880985703).

Then:

- Make sure the subscribed mods are in the right game folder:
  - Start the game once, enter the Workshop menu, then close the game
  - This makes the game copy the subscribed mods into the right place
- Make a symlink as __described below__
- Start the game
- Enable this mod from the Workshop menu (you don't need to enable the levels)
- Restart the game after enabling it
- Go to the level select
- Check the last few episodes. There should be 2 new ones
  - Check all the levels. If any are missing, you need to subscribe to them. If every level is missing even thugh you've subscribed to them, the symlink wasn't made properly.
  - Note: The new episods have some level spaces, shown with yellow police tape. This is normal. Red Storm has 7 levels, so there should be 5 spaces. Siege has 8 levels, so 4 spaces.

## Making a symlink

Making the symlink lets this Level Pack mod add downloaded workshop levels to the main game.

You can either download a batch script (.bat file) I made, or you can do this process manually.

I recommend the bat file, it's much simpler. It has lots of validation to make sure you're doing everything right.

For both methods you __must__ be using a PC account with admnistrator privileges.

### Method 1: Batch File

Here's a video of what this process looks like: https://youtu.be/2Wdphu0VGEc

- View this file on Github: [LEVEL_PACK_SETUP.bat](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/LEVEL_PACK_SETUP.bat)
- Press the Raw button, it's to the top-right of the top of the file preview
- Right-click the plain text that's now shown and chose "Save As"
- Save the file as LEVEL_PACK_SETUP.bat
- Move the file to the game's folder (find this through Steam: Right-click the game, go to Manage > Browse local files).
- LEVEL_PACK_SETUP.bat should now be in the same folder as ActionSquad.exe
- Right-click the .bat file and choose "Run as Administrator"
- It should work immediately. If it doesn't, make a screenshot and add it to the comments below (remember to use MS Paint to cover up yor PC username)
- That's it! :D

Here are screenshots of what happens when this works, and when it doesn't: [screenshots](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/validation.md)

### Method 2: Manual

It's a short process but there's a lot of explaining to do, so I've made a guide on Github here:

[Manual Symlink Guide](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/symlink-manual.md)

## FAQs

- Loads of questions are answered in the [FAQs on Github](https://github.com/ithinkandicode/door-kickers-action-squad-mods/blob/master/MODS/_LEVELS/Level%20Pack/Resources/Guides/questions.md)
- If you have any questions that aren't in the FAqs please add them to the comments

### Notes for modders

The game only supports up to 9 episodes (level packs), so unfortunately, if someone makes a new campaign, this mod can't be updated to support it -- it's already using all 9 episode slots.
