# Level Pack - REBALANCE Compatible

This version of Level Pack is compatible with [REBALANCE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853).

It __will not work__ without REBALANCE.

The setup process is the same. If you've alteady done it for the main Level Pack, you don't have to do it again.

### Notes for modders

REBALANCE was updated in v1.8.0 and now contains most of the files needed for this mod to work, except missions.xml, which this mod includes.

The files changed in the main version of Level Pack are:

- menus2.png
- menus.bsx
- strings.xml (and all variations of the language string XMLs)

If you want to make mod that's compatible with Level Pack but includes any of the files listed above, then as long as you add the level splashes to menus.bsx and add the level name strings to your strings.xml files, players will be able to use this mod with yours :)
