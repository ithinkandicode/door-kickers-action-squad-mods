RPG Tips: ODG's Redhead skill can force distance between you and your target. His penetration skill affects the RPG, so you can have piercing rockets if you want them. And his Breach Rocket has a large stun radius, beyond its blast radius, offering lots of strategic uses (like Shield's new shield alt in REBALANCE).

[h3]Valentine's Update (v1.4.0)[/h3]
Valentine's Day is approaching and the squad is getting in the mood!
[list]
[*] [b]ODG[/b] has slipped into a new pair of boxers. Maybe he's looking for love, maybe he's declaring it, either way he's looking damn fine!
[*] This year [b]Agent Fergie[/b] is teaching those bad guys who's boss with a new leather whip -- wuh-PSSSH!
[*] [b]Recon[/b] got this T-shirt on Valentine's Day 5 years ago. Still his favourite.
[*] This update also merges in everything from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853]REBALANCE[/url]!
[/list]

1.4.0 - Valentine's Update 2: "Comfy T-Shirt" for Recon, inspired by [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEvOOxfZmLw]this mod test[/url]. Also adds everything from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853]REBALANCE[/url]!

1.3.0 - Valentine's Update 1: Whip melee replacement for Agent. ODG boxers reskin.

1.2.2 - Cursed Revolver has been balanced around other guns from REBALANCE: Reduced clip size but heavily buffed damage, fire rate and AP.

1.0.0 - Heavy Armaments no longer have a carry speed penalty.

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
The whip passes through walls. There's no way around this, it would need custom behaviour hardcoded into the game.

The Milkor's explosion has no audio. This is due to a modding limitation: You can't set an "on impact" sound for custom explosions. The only workaround would be to use an existing explosion, but that would harm hostages.

The RPG reloads _really_ slowly if you reload while moving. Not sure why. Vanilla guns reload slower while moving, but not [i]that[/i] slow.

Molotov Cocktails trigger 3x mushroom cloud animations. This is due another mod restriction. You can't make custom explosions use different animations, all the fancy ones are hardcoded. So it uses the enemy molotov, but triggers three times to make the damage viable for players.
