‡ Agent's whip melee is temporarily disabled. You can't set a melee to only work with a single gun (there's code for this in the mod files, but it doesn't work). It has to be a a global replacement, but it can hamper the enjoyment of the rest of the mod if you're not a fan of it. At a later date, I'll make a version of this mod with the whip enabled.

[h3]Tips[/h3]
[b]RPG (ODG):[/b] ODG's "Redhead" skill can force distance between you and your target. His "+P Ammo" (penetration) skill affects the RPG, giving you piercing rockets -- this can help, but could also get you killed. Breach Rocket has a large stun radius, beyond its initial blast range, offering lots of strategic uses (similar to Shield's new "Emergency Grenade" shield alt in REBALANCE, which is included in this mod).

[b]Cursed Revolver (Shield)[/b]: Designed to mix things up, and brings chaos to co-op.

[/list]

[list]

[*] Fixed Agent's Silenced 1911 incorrectly using the icon for Breacher's Milkor

[/list]

[h3]Valentine's Update (v1.4.0)[/h3]
Valentine's Day is approaching and the squad is getting in the mood!
[list]
[*] [b]ODG[/b] has slipped into a new pair of boxers. Maybe he's looking for love, maybe he's declaring it, either way he's looking damn fine!
[*] This year [b]Agent Fergie[/b] is teaching those bad guys who's boss with a new leather whip -- wuh-PSSSH!
[*] [b]Recon[/b] got this T-shirt on Valentine's Day 5 years ago. Still his favourite.
[*] This update also merges in everything from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853]REBALANCE[/url]!
[/list]

1.4.0 - Valentine's Update 2: "Comfy T-Shirt" for Recon, inspired by [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEvOOxfZmLw]this mod test[/url]. Also adds everything from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853]REBALANCE[/url]!

1.3.0 - Valentine's Update 1: Whip melee replacement for Agent. ODG boxers reskin.

1.2.2 - Cursed Revolver has been balanced around other guns from REBALANCE: Reduced clip size but heavily buffed damage, fire rate and AP.

1.0.0 - Heavy Armaments no longer have a carry speed penalty.

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
The whip passes through walls. There's no way around this, it would need custom behaviour hardcoded into the game.

The Milkor's explosion has no audio. This is due to a modding limitation: You can't set an "on impact" sound for custom explosions. The only workaround would be to use an existing explosion, but that would harm hostages.

The RPG reloads _really_ slowly if you reload while moving. Not sure why. Vanilla guns reload slower while moving, but not [i]that[/i] slow.

Molotov Cocktails trigger 3x mushroom cloud animations. This is due to another mod restriction. You can't make custom explosions use different animations, all the fancy ones are hardcoded. So it uses the enemy molotov, but triggers three times to make the damage viable for players.
