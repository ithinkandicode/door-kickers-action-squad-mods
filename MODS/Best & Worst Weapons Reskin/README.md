# Best & Worst Weapons Reskin

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1948093436

**Description**

Reskins guns based on Sluggy's excellent [Characters & Weapons Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1911302566).

Applies visual ranks using his suggestions:

* **Worst**: NERF-style barrel tip ─ Low ROI. Under-powered, outclassed, or too situational.
* **Decent**: No visual change ─ High ROI. Versatile and worth trying.
* **Best**: Gold plating ─ Best in class.


**Notes**

Game version: 1.2.2

This mod is helpful if you're new to the game and don't know which guns to buy first. Once you've got a ton of stars it's worth experimenting a bit to find out what works best for you :)

Shield has no **best** gun as only two of their pistols are **decent**; a strong one and an armor-piercing one.
