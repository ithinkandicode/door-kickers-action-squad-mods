Re-balances classes and their weapons.

This mod is designed around single player, and it makes the game easier.

Guns are more distinct and varied. Ultimates are buffed.

Changes will help you however far you've progressed.

[h2]Objectives[/h2]
[list]
[*] Make every gun worth unlocking
[*] Balance Ultimates to compare fairly to Sniper Support
[*] Don't change star costs, balance guns around existing costs
[*] Change as little as possible and limit overhauls
[*] Focus on fun, not real-world gun gun attributes
[*] Add more ways to tackle armor
[*] Add faster ways to breach
[*] Add new ways to play in co-op
[*] Make Agent and Shield's pistols more varied
[*] Make Shield more interesting in solo
[*] Make ODG more distinct from Assaulter
[*] Make Recon faster
[*] Buffs not nerfs
[/list]

[h2]Changes[/h2]

Hopefully you'll want to jump right in and see the changes for yourself. There are a few surprises.

Some changes are easy to miss, so here's a brief list. Links to the ful change list are at the end, and I'll be [i]adding images over the next week to highlight the major changes[/i].

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
[*] Reduced some skill perk costs for Agent, Recon and ODG (no more "just out of reach" builds!)
[*] Barrels explode faster!
[*] Extra Gear now gives you 2 items, instead of 1
[*] Changes from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1967531389]Calm Hostages[/url]
[/list]

[h3]Assaulter[/h3]
[list]
[*] PDWs are completely rebalanced, their stats show the changes
[*] PDWs also boost movement speed by 10%!
[*] MCX has a reduced fire rate - it fires as slow as you'd need to shoot in vanilla to actually land shots (and its recoil is better too). No ranged damage loss makes it worth trying
[*] LMG Ultimate is a monster - it does more damage with less recoil, AND IT CAN BREACH!
[/list]

[h3]Breacher[/h3]
[list]
[*] Buffed M870's fire rate and reload speed, it's still the only shotgun that doesn't slow you down while shooting
[*] Rebalanced S12K Tactical, based on the AA12
[*] SIX12 is no longer unusable, and with the right perks it's slugs are awesome
[*] Breach Saw can rampage! You get a larger clip and you move faster with it
[/list]

[h3]Shield[/h3]
[list]
[*] Shield got a lot of love in this mod!
[*] All her pistols have a higher fire rate
[*] Her guns don't have alts, so now they have a description!
[*] Shield Bash can breach fast with a bash then a kick
[*] 1-shot criticals with her Revolver! ([i]community suggestion[/i])
[*] Her SMG deals AP damage now and lasts longer
[/list]

[h3]Agent[/h3]
[list]
[*] Agent's pistols are way more varied now
[*] She has a [b]silenced 1911[/b] with less recoil
[*] Her Revolver isn't so slow its Aimed Shot has a [i]very[/i] fast cooldown
[*] G18C Auto Pistol has a semi-auto mod ([i]community suggestion[/i])
[*] Tons of variety in general
[*] Akimbo has AP on par with the FiveSeven
[*] Her Cherry Darling perk boost damage now too
[/list]

[h3]Recon[/h3]
[list]
[*] Recon was always a difficult class - high rewards but high investment. Now he's set to "Hard"
[*] Marksman Rifle lasts a little longer, and it actually tells you how its damage buff works
[*] Moves fast! Climbs even faster!
[/list]

[h3]ODG[/h3]
[list]
[*] Tricked-Out AK is even more trickout out -- now it's got a silencer
[*] Trapper Rifle is (slightly) more viable against armor, so if you want to storm the final chapter with it, you can now (good luck!)
[*] Garand has way more manageable recoil and a larger clip
[/list]

[h3]QoL[/h3]
[list]
[*] Quality of life changes from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1968545614]QoL[/url]
[*] New text changes, plus improvements on the QoL mod's presentation
[*] Every bit of text in the game should be clear now!
[/list]

[h2]Last Bit[/h2]
I love this game. Modding it was a great excuse to clock up over 100 hours, and I don't regret any of it.

[h3]Thank yous[/h3]
This might be the only chance to say this, so it's time for a big manly gush.

I'd like to give a massive thank you to the developers. You guys made something amazing here, and I really appreciate that you gave us the tools to change how the games looks and feels -- and to let other people experience our ideas too.

Thank you too to the other modders who have worked hard to keep the game interesting. Especially to visual modders [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/squillen/myworkshopfiles/?appid=686200]Squillen[/url] (your attention to detail is really inspiring), to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/squillen/myworkshopfiles/?appid=686200]chelovek[/url] (your Zeal Squad mod is impressive as hell), and to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/eeeekl/myworkshopfiles/]hoba[/url] (your Heavy Armemants mod inspired me to get into proper modding).

Shoutouts also to the amazing map makers who have done things I couldn't dream of - especially [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041145962/myworkshopfiles/?appid=686200]Stryker_Ben[/url] (your Red Storm campaign is so good, and your synopses make the maps feel even more engaging) and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/HARUMORI/myworkshopfiles/?appid=686200]Haru Moritaka[/url] (the Dark Souls of DK:AS maps! Gripping, strategic and addictive, I look forward to (dying a lot in) each one)
