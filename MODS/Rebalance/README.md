# Rebalance

## Description

Re-balances classes and their weapons.

This mod is designed around single player, and it makes the game easier.

Guns are more distinct and varied. Ultimates are buffed.

Changes will help you however far you've progressed.

A full list of changes are below.

### Primary Goals

- Give Shield and Agent more ways to handle armor, apart from the F7AP
- Make early guns feel more worth unlocking
- Balance Ultimates so they all compare fairly to Sniper Support
- Don't change star costs, balance guns around the vanilla costs instead
- Keep the vanilla "feel" of each gun and change as little as possible
- Focus on fun, not real-world gun gun attributes
- Give players more approaches to breaching
- Add new ways to play in co-op
- Always buff, never nerf

### Abbreviations

- DPS = Damage per second
- AP = Armor Penetration (0-5: Aimed Shots & Garand have 5; Recon's CBJ has 4; other AP guns have 3).
- STK = Shots to kill non-armored hostiles.


## QoL

Includes changes from [QoL](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1968545614) mod, plus:

- Gear - Item counts now shown below description (instead of changing the item name)
- Breacher - Weak Spotter perk: Makes it clear that the perk gives shotguns AP
- Breacher - 1911 Pistol: Mentions 4 * 7 uses
- Shield - Alt text gives weapon descriptions (unfortunately only possible with Shield as she has no alts)
- Agent - FBI Armor is now distinct from Improved Armor, as it has different stats in vanilla (both still unlock at once)
- Workshop - Text for incompatible mods is a bit easier to understand


## Gear

- Extra Gear now gives you 2 extra items (instead of 1)


## Gameplay

- Changes from [Calm Hostages](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1967531389) mod
- Barrels have less health, they now explode after a few shots


## Assaulter

__MP7 PDW__: Increased damage. DPS is on par with the M4A1, but it burns through ammo quickly. Recoil is manageable in 3-4 shot bursts. It's small size grants a bonus to movement speed.

__P90 PDW__: Increased damage. DPS is on par with the modded MCX. Virtually no recoil and no ranged damage loss, giving the P90 excellent long-ranged precision. Its lightweight frame grants a bonus to movement speed, and its huge clip and lack of recoil management makes it perfect for co-op with less experienced players.

__M4A1__: _Unchanged_. Strongest at medium range in 2-shot bursts. Very high DPS, with high recoil and high ranged damage loss.

__MCX300__: Now a worthy competitor to the M4A1, the MCX has a lower fire rate but no ranged damage loss, guaranteeing a 2-STK. Reliable damage makes reloads infrequent.

__LMG Ultimate__: Now way more powerful, with higher damage and more penetration. It's reduced recoil makes burst fire much safer around hostages. Also, IT CAN BREACH.

_Note on MCX's reduced fire rate: The vanilla MCX is an excellent weapon. Its huge recoil is offset with an incredibly fast recoil recovery, making shooting in 1-shot bursts a necessity. Its lack of ranged damage loss makes it technically superior to the M4A1. But without this being clear to players, it immediately feels unusable. Its new reduced fire rate essentially emulates the approach to take in vanilla, giving you recoil-free fire up to 6 shots. Its max spread is also halved, so when the recoil kicks in, it's much less jarring._


## Breacher

Breacher's health is increased to help him last longer in ranged battles.

__M870 Room Clearer__: Higher fire rate with the fastest shell reloads in class. Like in vanilla, it doesn't slow you down while shooting, and it no longer has the unique attrribut of slowing you down while holding it (actually, it nowspeeds you up a little!).

__S12K Tactical Shotgun__: Overhauled and is now modelled on the popular AA12. It has a tight spread, low recoil, faster reloads and a ferocious fire rate. It also has higher mobility.

__HK12__: _Unchanged_. It's horizontal spread mode is still tighter than the S12K, but it's recoil prevents fast slam fire shots hitting at range.

__SIX12__: Fires faster with greater accuracy. Slug shots combo _really_ well with the Rifled Slugs perk.

__Breach Saw__: Now you can rampage with a breach saw! It lasts longer and increases movement speed while held and using. Great fun against melee hostiles. (Note: saw vs. rifle is a risky bet. Press alt fire to disgard it if things heat up)


## Shield

All pistols have an increased fire rate. You can still spam fire them to sacrifice accuracy for huge DPS.

Shield's guns now have descriptions, so you don't have to keep alt-tabbing to this list ;)

Gun stats now display Accuracy, instead of Recoil, which gives you a better idea of each weapon's handling. The stat shows you accuracy over a few shots, not just the first.

__P226__: Now has the fastest reload in her class by far.

__MP40__: Strongest at range, with little damage loss over distance and fast recoil recovery. Best in 3-round bursts. Can 2-STK with Lady Justiec criticals, but suffers at range.

__1911__: Recoil is more manageable. Now same AP (1) as Shield's other basic pistols. Very little ranged damage loss.

__F7AP__: Now fires faster, and retains vanilla's great accuracy, low recoil and huge clip.

__SWAT Revolver__: Huge damage potential with 1-STK criticals with Lady Justice. Reloads faster.

__Tactical Shield - Shield Bash Alt__: Now has higher breach damage. You can break doors in two hits, with a bash and a kick. This makes Shield feel faster and more unique, especially in single-player.

__Rifle Resistant Shield__: Reduced reload speed penalty to match Tactical Shield (-15%). Retains its unique mvoement speed penalty.

__Rifle Resistant Shield - New Alt__: Emergency Grenade. Sacrifice armor to protect your health from melee. Very powerful with shield HP perks, and with points into the team Straegic Points Gain bar for fast armor recovery.

__SMG Assault__: Heavily buffed. It has a larger clip, more dmage, and tears through armor.


## Agent

Two of Agent's pistols in vanilla have 0 AP (MP40 & 1911), which limited your options against armor. Now they have the same AP as her other non-AP guns (1).

__MP40__: No longer a "must skip" weapon, it now has a unique fast Double Tap with a shorter cooldown.

__1911__: The poor ~~mans~~ agent's M1076 is now a [b]silenced pistol[/b], and the recoil is more manageable. It keeps its fast recoil recovery and low ranged damage loss, making it great for stealth kills from a distance.

__F7AP__: Now a lot more powerful, its increased damage lets you 3-STK hostiles, or 2-STK with Double Tap.

__FBI Revolver__: It's new unique Fast Aimed Shot has a shorter cooldown, to help you make the most of the small clip and keep Agent moving quickly.

__G18C Auto Pstol__: Now has a single-shot alt (_community suggestion_), making it slightly more pratical to use.

__Akimbo Pistols__: Now have high AP on par with F7AP (3), giving Agent a new and reliable way to eliminate armored hostiles.

__MP5K__: Now has a small amount of AP (1), making it slightly more viable in later levels.

__MP5K + Cherry Darling__: Agent's last Tactics perk in vanilla removes MP5K's recoil, now it increases its damage too. Your bullets will sail over the hostages and take out hostiles quickly.

__Skills__: Big Banger skill perk costs 1 point less.


## Recon

Recon is a class that needs investment and practise, so his difficulty is now set to "Hard".

Recon moves faster and climbs much faster, to better match his description of "fast". (He's stil slightly slower than an unarmored Agent).

His vanilla guns are very well balanced so needed only a minor tweak.

__MP5 Suppressed__: Set AP to 1 (up from 0). It already has the lowest DPS, this makes it less terrible against armor.

__Markman Rifle__: +1 to clip size (now 6). Without the aimed damage buff you can now take ot 3 hostiles (or 6 with it). Description also now mentions the buff feature.

__Skills__: Double Tools skill perk costs 1 point less.

__New Skills__: Fast Feet (Recon branch): Increases speed by 15%.


## ODG

ODG now climbs slightly faster, helpng you maximise your Twinkie invincibility time.

__Trapper Rifle__: Decreased initial spread by half, making your shots much less likely to hit hostages.

__Trikked-Out AK__: ODG's AK is now even more tricked-out, and comes with silencer. This makes him even more unique, being the only class with a high-powered silent wepon, and is perfect for stealth co-op with Recon.

__Garand__: Larger clip and less recoil makes this Ultimate feel even more powerful.

__Twinkie__: Now lasts for 12 seconds (up from 5). A new sound effect tells you when its run out.

__SKills__: Twixie & Plates cost 1 point less.
