# Rebalance

## Description

### Main

Re-balances classes and their weapons.

This mod is designed around single player, and it makes the game easier.

Guns are more distinct and varied. They give you more ways to play, offer more options against armor, and their DPS and time-to-kill increase more linearly.

Ultimates are buffed to better match the utlity of Sniper Support.

Changes give benefits regardless of your skill level and progression.


### Primary Goals

- Give Shield and Agent more ways to handle armor, apart from the F7AP
- Make early guns feel worth unlocking, instead of skipping to the most powerful guns
- Balance Ultimates so they all compare fairly to Sniper Support
- Don't change star costs, balance guns around the vanilla costs instead
- Keep the vanilla "feel" of each gun and change as little as possible
- Focus on fun, not real-world gun gun attributes
- Add new ways to play in co-op
- Always buff, never nerf!

### Abbreviations

- DPS = Damage per second
- AP = Armor Penetration (0-5). Aimed Shots have 5 AP, Recon's CBJ has 4, and all other AP guns have 3.
- STK = Shots to kill non-armored enemies.

## QoL

Many "quality of life" changes have been made to text, mainly to explain hidden machanics. See the standalone [QoL mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1968545614) for full details.


## Gear

Extra Gear now gives you 2 extra items, instead of 1, making it a viable alternative to armor.


## Gameplay

Changes from [Calm Hostages](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1967531389) mod: Bomb hostages never panic and run at you, and Detonator Dick is less likely to do a revenge-splode.


## Assaulter

UMP45: _Unchanged_. It's well balanced for an early gun. Strongest in bursts.

MP7 PDW: An upgraded UMP45. Low recoil in bursts. Large clip.

P90 PDW: Huge clip, slow reloads. Works well with Mag Ready.

M4A1: _Unchanged_. High damage, 2-STK, but suffera at a distance due to high recoil and ranged damage loss.

MCX300: Low fire rate but no ranged damage loss, always a 2-STK. Reliable damage makes reloads infrequent.

LMG Ultimate: Higher damage with more penetration. Reduced recoil makes burst fire much safer around hostages. Oh, and IT CAN BREACH.


## Breacher

Breacher's health is increased to help him last longer in ranged battles.

M870 Room Clearer fires and reloads faster. It keeps its unique vanila attribute of being the only shotgun that doesn't slow you down while shooting, and it's relatively low damage compared to other shotguns gives you a better chance at keeping hostages alive.

S12K Tactical Shotgun has been completely rebalanced. It's now modelled on the popular AA12, with a tight spread and very low recoil, as well as higher mobility and a faster reload. It retains it's vanilla low penetration, but this makes it even easier to keep hostages behind hostiles alive.

HK12 is _unchanged_. It's horizontal spread mode is stil tighter than the S12K, but it's recoil prevents fast slam fire shots hitting at range.

The SIX12 has been buffed all round. It's now as powerful as "revolver shotgun" sounds.

Breach Saw lasts longer, and you'll move faster while carrying and using it. (Note: Brach Saw vs. machine gun is a risky bet. Press alt fire to disgard it if things heat up)


## Shield

Shield's pistols all have an increased fire rate. The fire about as fast as they can without causing too much recoil.

P226 now reloads even faster (fastest in class by far).

MP40 is perfect for ranged battles. , almost guaranteeing a 3-STK from any distance. Its fast recoil recovery makes it best shot in 3-round bursts.

1911's recoil is more manageable, and it now has the same AP as Shield's other basic pistols.

F7AP already had great accuracy and low recoil. Now it's fire rate has been increased significantly too.

SWAT Revolver now deals huge damage. With Shield's Lady Justice perk it's capable of 1-STK on surprised hostiles, and it reloads faster too.

Tactical Shield stuns for longer, and Rifle Resistant Shield now has the same reload speed penalty as the Tactical Shield (-15%).

SMG Assault Ultimate has been heavily buffed. It lasts longer, does more damage, and tears through armor like paper.

_TIP: Pistols can be fired as fast as you can press FIRE. You'll sacrifice accuracy for huge DPS, which is very effective at close range._


## Agent

Note: Like with Shield's pistols, you can hammer the FIRE button quickly for high DPs at close range.

The MP40 has low recoil, but it didn't do anything special. Now it has a unique fast Double Tap.

The 1911 was a poor ~~mans~~ agent's M1076. Now it stands out as Agent's single silenced pistol, and its recoil more manageable. Just be careful around armor!

F7AP hits harder, and can 2-STK unarmorered enemies with Double Tap.

The FBI Revolver is more viable against armor, with a unique Fast Aimed Shot and a faster reload.

The G18C Auto Pstol is fine as it is, dealing insane DPS.

Akimbo now has much higher AP.

Maxing Tactics now buffs MP5K damage (in addition to recoil), and the MP5K gains a small amount of AP.



## Recon

Recon now moves faster, especially on ladders.

Recon's vanilla guns are very well balanced, so no changes were needed.

Markman Rifle Ultimate lasts longer. (Tip: Hold your aim to deal more damage)

His difficulty is now set to "Hard".


## ODG

AK is even more tricked-out.

ODG's Twinkie now lasts much longer, making it a more viable alternative to a satchel full of Flashbangs.

Garand has less recoil and lasts longer.
