# Rebalance Wishlist

Some things can't currently be modded. A few more tweaks I wish could be done:

## High Priority

Gameplay:

- [ ] Allow saving stars when using mods!

Weapons Pack:

- [ ] Allow melee replacement in `sTemplateOverwrite` (it looks like this should be supported, but unfortunately isn't atm. I would use it to give Agent a Whip+Revolver weapon combo; atm you have to replace her melee globally)
- [ ] Explosions: Allow setting a custom impact SFX. Would be used by Hoba's Milkor GL, and for new incendiary grnades

Perks:

- [ ] Assaulter: Allow changing "Assault Jump" values (I would set it to ~150 damage, and might adjust the height threshold)

## Low Priority

New skill perks:

- [ ] Breacher: "Saw Rampage" ─ Reduced damage while weilding / Panics enemies, reducing their accuracy
- [ ] Shield: "Early Riser" ─ Start with +2 Strategic Points
- [ ] Agent: "What explosion?" ─ Reduced damage taken from explosions
- [ ] Recon: "Dextrous" ─ Can reload on ladders (would need new sprites)
- [ ] ODG: "Secret Ingredient" - Pie also grants team fire rate increase (20% for 12s, Twinkie synergy)

Perk enhancements:

- [ ] Recon: Buff 5% "crippling" skill chance to 10%

General buffs:

- [ ] Shield: Cancel reloads with Shield Bash
