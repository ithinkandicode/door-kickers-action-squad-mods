# REBALANCE Update 1.10.0

## Classes

### Shield

- SWAT Revolver: Reduced ranged damage loss (`fBulletDamageLossPPx`: 0.08 > 0.03). This should allow criticals to proc at long range, without making the base weapon too much more powerful

### Recon

- Reduced the new movement speed skill from 15% > 10%, as it felt too fast


## Misc

### Text

- Shield - 1911: Added affix to description to account for ranged damage loss - Now says: _2 shot kills at close range_
- Shield - G18C: Made description sound less uninviting - Replaced _terrible recoil_ with _very high recoil_
