# Rebalance Wishlist

Some things can't currently be modded. A few more tweaks I wish could be done:

New Tactics skill perks:

- [ ] Breacher: "Saw Rampage" ─ Reduced damage while weilding / Panics enemies, reducing their accuracy
- [ ] Shield: "Early Riser" ─ Start with +2 Strategic Point
- [ ] Agent: "What explosion?" ─ Reduced damage taken from explosions
- [ ] Recon: "Dextrous" ─ Can reload on ladders
- [ ] ODG: "Secret Ingredient" -  Pie also grants team fire rate increase (20% for 12s, Twinkie synergy)

Perk enhanecments:

- [ ] Assaulter: Change "Assault Jump" to: Landing on enemies deals 150 damage
- [ ] Recon: Buff 5% "crippling" skill chance to 10%

General buffs:

- [ ] Shield: Cancel reloads with Shield Bash
- [ ] Recon: Marksman Rifle can shoot from ladders
