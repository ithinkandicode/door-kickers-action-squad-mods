# Megapack

Megapack includes the following mods:

- [REBALANCE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1973847853)
- [Level Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980275432) (requires setup, see mod description)
- [Cheat - Unlock Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1967533005)
- [Cheat - Unlock Missions](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1967532587)

Certain mods stop stars from saving, whih means you can't progress while they're enabled.

So I made this mod, which unlocks everything, as requested by 老龙. It lets you use REBALANCE and play the Red Storm and Siege episodes freely, ven .

__For Level Pack, please remember to follow the setup outlined in the [mod description](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1980275432).__
