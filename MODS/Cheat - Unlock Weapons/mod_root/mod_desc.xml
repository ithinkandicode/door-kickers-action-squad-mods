<!--All paths are relative to mod root folder (where this file resides).

"type" can be SINGLE_LEVEL (level will have mod's name) or GAME_CHANGER (levels don't get loaded in the Downloaded Levels section)

"name" should be a short(and unique) name.Never update it in the Steam Workshop interface, only update through this file.

"image" shows up in-game but also in Steam Workshop. Should be a 16:9 PNG image.

"tags" only show up in Steam Workshop. comma-separated values. preferably one of: "Levels,Enemies,Objects,Replays,Weapons,Armor,Gear,Total Conversions,Interface,Sound,Other".

EDIT: Only the following tags are displayed in the Steam Workshop:
	Levels,Interface,Enemies,Weapons,Translations

"gameVersion" leave it as it is in this template (assuming you have the latest game version). It's also shown in-game in the credits screen.
When we'll update the game with a newer version, the mod will probably be invalidated and you'll have to update it for the new version.

"changeNotes" only used when updating a published mod on Workshop, redundant otherwise
