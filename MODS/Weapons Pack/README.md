## Description

Contains 6 custom weapons: 3 new, 3 from Hoba's [Heavy Armaments](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1571754830) pack.

The three new weapons are fun, powerful, and completely impractical.

The Heavy Armaments guns have been edited slightly to remove the carry speed penalty.

### Tips

The weapons in this pack are balanced for experienced players. They are all powerful but have distinct drawbacks, offering new challenges and different ways to play.

Assaulter's AUG HBAR: ...

Breacher's flamethrower makes collateral damage hard to avoid, but baiting enemies and lading well-timed molotovs can keep you keep hostages alive. Using the flamethrower mid-jump can help.

Shield's Cursed Reolver solves one of her biggest weaknesses by making her vulnerable in a different way. Spamming the FIRE button can scatter her shots.

Agent's Automag V: Patience and positioning is key here. If you invest in Agent's explosions skill and using lots of Breaching Charges will give you the openings you need, with time to roll away for cover.

ODG's RPG is all about distance. His Redhead skill helps to make some, and his a good fallback if things get too close. His RPG also works well in co-op with Shield, as she has high suvivability against explosions.

### Known Issues

The Milkor's explosion has no audio. This is due to a limitation in how mods work. You can't set an "on impact" sound for custom explosions. The only workaround would be to use an existing explosion, but that would harm hostages.

The RPG reloads _really_ slowly if you reload while moving. Not sure why, or if this is a bug or a feature in vanilla.

The RPG's Molotov Cocktail alt triggers 3 mushroom cloud animations. This is due to the sound restriction, and another that prevents custom animations, as explosion sounds and animation seem to be hardcoded and depend on the explosion name. As a workaround, Molotovs use the existing Molotov explosion, but fire 3 "bullets" at once, to make their damage viable.

### Updates

#### 1.3.0 - Valentine's Day Update

Whip melee replacement for Agent. ODG boxers reskin.
