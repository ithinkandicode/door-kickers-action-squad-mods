[h2]Valentine's Day Update (v1.3.0)[/h2]
Valentine's Day is approaching, and ODG is already in the mood with a new pair of boxers!

Meanwhile, Agent Fergie figured what better time to showing the bad guys what VALENTINES'S DAY JUSTICE looks like (spoiler: it looks like a whip to the face!)

[h3]Description[/h3]

Contains 7 custom weapons: 1 new melee weapon, 3 new guns, and 3 guns from Hoba's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1571754830]Heavy Armaments[/url] pack.

[h3]Updates[/h3]
1.3.0 - Valentine's Day Update: Whip melee replacement for Agent. ODG boxers reskin.

1.2.2 - Balance Cursed Revolver around other guns from the Rebalance mod. Reduced clip size but heavily buffed damage, fire rate and AP

1.0.0 - Edited Heavy Armaments guns to remove carry speed penalty.

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
The Milkor's explosion has no audio. This is due to a modding limitation: You can't set an "on impact" sound for custom explosions. The only workaround would be to use an existing explosion, but that would harm hostages.

The RPG reloads _really_ slowly if you reload while moving. Not sure why. Vanilla guns reload slower while moving, but not [i]that[/i] slow.

The RPG's Molotov Cocktail alt triggers 3 mushroom cloud animations. This is due to the sound restriction, and another that prevents custom animations for custom explosions. All custom animations are hardcoded, so you can't create a new explosion type and say "make it use X existing animation". As a workaround, Molotovs use the existing Molotov explosion, but fire 3 "bullets" at once, making their damage viable for players.
