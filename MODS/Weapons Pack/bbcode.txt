Contains 6 custom weapons: 3 new, 3 from Hoba's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1571754830]Heavy Armaments[/url] pack.

The three new weapons are fun, powerful, and completely impractical.

The Heavy Armaments guns have been edited slightly to remove the carry speed penalty.

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
The Milkor's explosion has no audio. This is due to a limitation in how mods work. You can't set an "on impact" sound for custom explosions. The only workaround would be to use an existing explosion, but that would harm hostages.

The RPG reloads _really_ slowly if you reload while moving. Not sure why, or if this is a bug or a feature in vanilla.

The RPG's Molotov Cocktail alt triggers 3 mushroom cloud animations. This is due to the sound restriction, and another that prevents custom animations, as explosion sounds and animation seem to be hardcoded and depend on the explosion name. As a workaround, Molotovs use the existing Molotov explosion, but fire 3 "bullets" at once, to make their damage viable.
