[h2]Valentine's Day Update (v1.4.0)[/h2]
Valentine's Day is approaching and the squad is getting in the mood!

ODG has slipped into a new pair of boxers. Maybe he's looking for love, maybe he's declaring it, either way he's looking damn fine!

Agent Fergie knows that Justice never sleeps, not even for Valentine's Day.  This year she's teaching those bad guys who's the boss with a braided leather whip -- wuh-PSSSH!

Recon got this T-shirt on Valentine's Day 5 yeas ago. It's still his favourite.

[h3]Description[/h3]

Contains 7 custom weapons: 1 new melee weapon, 3 new guns, and 3 guns from Hoba's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1571754830]Heavy Armaments[/url] pack.

RPG Tips: ODG's Redhead skill can force distance between you and your target. His penetration skill affects the RPG, so you can have piercing rockets if you want them! And his Breach Rocket has a large stun radius, offering lots of strategic uses.

[h3]Updates[/h3]
1.3.0 - Valentine's Day Update: Whip melee replacement for Agent. ODG boxers reskin.

1.2.2 - Balance Cursed Revolver around other guns from the Rebalance mod. Reduced clip size but heavily buffed damage, fire rate and AP

1.0.0 - Edited Heavy Armaments guns to remove carry speed penalty.

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
The Milkor's explosion has no audio. This is due to a modding limitation: You can't set an "on impact" sound for custom explosions. The only workaround would be to use an existing explosion, but that would harm hostages.

The RPG reloads _really_ slowly if you reload while moving. Not sure why. Vanilla guns reload slower while moving, but not [i]that[/i] slow.

The RPG's Molotov Cocktail alt triggers 3 mushroom cloud animations. This is due to the sound restriction, and another that prevents custom animations for custom explosions. All custom animations are hardcoded, so you can't create a new explosion type and say "make it use X existing animation". As a workaround, Molotovs use the existing Molotov explosion, but fire 3 "bullets" at once, making their damage viable for players.
