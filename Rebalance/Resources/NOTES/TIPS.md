## Tips

If you're having a bit of trouble these tips might help.

### Agent Fergie

With early pistols, you can spam the fire button to sacrifice accuracy for DPS.

Agent excels with Breach Charges. Her knife can draw attention to normal doors, and her explosive skill perk will have you throwing that C4 at every opportunity (enemy below? C4. Enemy up a ladder? C4. Enemy chasing you through doorways? Flashbang... lol jk, C4!).

Against armor, roll in close with and lay waste with Agent's G18C Auto Pistol, or take the bad guys out like a pro with her Revolver's new fast Aimed Shot.

### Recon

Enemies will always beat Recon's low DPS, so play slow, learn their patterns, and outsmart them.

Recon takes investment. Skill perks really make this class.

The Silenced Shotgun is a beast in the early levels.

Get the first perk on his second branch first. It really makes up for that DPS gap.

Recon's last perk on his top skill branch guarantees crits (+33% damage) on targetted enemies.

Know when to use normal fire vs. Rapid Fire. Normal fire is good for close-quarters: If you're close enough to land all your shots, use it. For distance, use Rapid Fire. Rapid Fire has a lower DPS, but higher damage per-shot, high range, and excellent accuracy.

Against armor, try the CBJ. It's loud, but it's massive 4 AP shreds armor (with the highest AP bar Aimed Shot). And while it's DPS is lower than the MP7 due to MP7's higher fire rate, it's STK is actually lower (6 vs 7) with the same clip size (30), giving you more time to shoot between reloads. Once you're comfortable with Recon you can go back to his MP7 for those silent kills.

### General

It's always OK to resort to Breacher, he can help you learn level layouts.

The perk trees are very well designed. They can help you understand how to use each class best.

Flashbangs are good on levels with ladders.

You can shoot while jumping.

Most guns will let you peek through an elevator/doorway, lay a couple shots, and disappear again.

Breaching Charges are insanely powerful. They stick to everything.

Even armoured enemies (the ones who shoot at kicked doors) will eventually wander. Learn their timing and you can use it against them.

Aimed Shot always has 5 AP, the highest AP possible. It kills most armoured enemies on 1 shot.
